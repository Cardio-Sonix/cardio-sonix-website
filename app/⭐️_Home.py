    The problem is of particular interest to machine learning researchers 
    as it involves classification of audio sample data, 
    where distinguishing between classes of interest is non-trivial. 
    Data is gathered in real-world situations 
    and frequently contains background noise of every conceivable type. 
    The differences between heart sounds corresponding 
    to different heart symptoms can also be extremely subtle 
    and challenging to separate. Success in classifying this 
    form of data requires extremely robust classifiers. 
    Despite its medical significance, 
    to date this is a relatively unexplored application for machine learning.
