            Heart disease has remained the leading cause of death worldwide for 20 years. 
            However, they have never claimed as many lives as they do today. 
            Deaths from cardiovascular disease have increased by more than 2 million since 2000, reaching nearly 9 million in 2019. 
            Heart disease today accounts for 16% of all deaths worldwide.

        The problem is of particular interest to machine learning researchers 
        as it involves classification of audio sample data, 
        where distinguishing between classes of interest is non-trivial. 
        Data is gathered in real-world situations 
        and frequently contains background noise of every conceivable type. 
        The differences between heart sounds corresponding 
        to different heart symptoms can also be extremely subtle 
        and challenging to separate. Success in classifying this 
        form of data requires extremely robust classifiers. 
        Despite its medical significance, 
        to date this is a relatively unexplored application for machine learning.
