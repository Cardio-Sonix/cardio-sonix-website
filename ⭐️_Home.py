            According to the World Health Organisation, 
            cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally: 
            more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. 
            An estimated 17.1 million people died from CVDs in 2004, 
            representing 29% of all global deaths. 
            Of these deaths, an estimated 7.2 million were due to coronary heart disease.

            Any method which can help to detect signs of heart disease 
            could therefore have a significant impact on world health. 
            This challenge is to produce methods to do exactly that. 
            Specifically, we are interested in creating the first level of screening 
            of cardiac pathologies both in a Hospital environment by a doctor 
            (using a digital stethoscope) and at home by the patient (using a mobile device).

        The problem is of particular interest to machine learning researchers 
        as it involves classification of audio sample data, 
        where distinguishing between classes of interest is non-trivial. 
        Data is gathered in real-world situations 
        and frequently contains background noise of every conceivable type. 
        The differences between heart sounds corresponding 
        to different heart symptoms can also be extremely subtle 
        and challenging to separate. Success in classifying this 
        form of data requires extremely robust classifiers. 
        Despite its medical significance, 
        to date this is a relatively unexplored application for machine learning.
