        ##### Strongest cellular poison üß™
        Being the strongest cellular poison, alcohol damages the cells of the heart muscle 
        and increases blood pressure (even with a single dose - for several days), 
        poisoning the nervous and cardiovascular systems. 
        A sharp increase in blood pressure can lead to a hypertensive crisis, 
        myocardial infarction and stroke. 
        
        ##### The most harmful alcohol üç∫
        The most harmful alcohol can be called beer, 
        the cobalt contained in the foam increases the load on the heart muscle.
        
        ##### Bovine heart ü´Ä
        With frequent use of alcohol, 
        an excess amount of fat accumulates in the heart muscle, 
        it is reborn, becomes flabby. 
        The heart becomes weak, enlarged and can hardly cope with its work, 
        the so-called "alcoholic" or "bovine" heart develops. 
        The result of such disorders is hypertension and premature atherosclerosis.

        Nicotine causes an increase in blood pressure and heart rate,

        ##### Tobacco smoke
        Tobacco smoke contains carbon monoxide (carbon monoxide), 
        which prevents the blood from carrying oxygen. 
        Therefore, to supply the body with oxygen, the heart has to work harder. 
        Smoking also contributes to the deposition of fats in the blood vessels, 
        constricts them and increases blood pressure.
        
        ##### Cardiac spasm
        Cardiac spasm is the most common complication of smoking. 
        The result of such a spasm can be a myocardial infarction - the necrosis of a section of the 
        heart muscle due to a violation of its nutrition.

        Almost all fresh fruits are good for the heart.

        By the way, all dark-colored berries (blueberries, blackberries, currants) not only replenish 
        the body's vitamin supply and nourish the heart muscle, 
        but also increase the level of hemoglobin in the blood.
        
        ##### Calcium
        The heart system needs not only plant foods, but also calcium. 
        It can be obtained from: 
        * milk ü•õ
        * cheese üßÄ
        * yogurt
        
        ##### Dairy-free with calcium

        the lack of calcium is compensated by the consumption:
        * fish (salmon and sardines) üç£

        ##### The heart needs sleep too 
        Sleep is a time of rest for the whole body. 
        Even the heart, which works day and night, naturally slows down during sleep. 
        Therefore, poor heart function caused by heart disease can deprive the body of normal rest during sleep. 
        Moreover, the relationship between heart function and the sleep process operates in two directions. 
        For example, sleep-related respiratory disorders have been shown to play an important role 
        in the development of certain types of heart and vascular disease.
        
        ##### How much sleep? 
        On average, the duration of sleep should be about seven hours. 
        Adults are recommended to sleep for seven to nine hours, 
        but for people over 65, six to eight hours is enough.
