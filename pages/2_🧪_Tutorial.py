    ### Should I just lie down?
    Almost, but it would be nice to know a couple of details about how to breathe.
    While recording, you should inhale slowly and then hold your breath for 5 seconds.
    After holding your breath, exhale slowly through your mouth
    so that your breath does not get on the record. 
    The length of the recording with which you can work is 10 seconds. 
    Keep in mind that if there are 30 seconds in the recording, 
    then it will be divided into three parts and you will get three results, 
    but if there are less than 10 seconds, you will get an error.   
    
    ### Notes:
    - phone should be in a vertical position
    - distance between your body and the phone should not remain
    - try not to move or make unnecessary sounds
    - make sure you put the phone on the side with the microphone
